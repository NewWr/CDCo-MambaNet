## Preprocessing Overview

Two preprocessing routes are assumed:

rs-fMRI: DPABI/DPARSFA-based preprocessing followed by ROI time-series (ROISignals) extraction.

sMRI (T1w): SimpleITK-based preprocessing including bias correction, (optional) skull stripping, MNI normalization, and reshaping to 96×96×96.
